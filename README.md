# MaxSubSequenceSum
It shows the different algorithms about maxSubSequenceSum.
The first is the easiest program we can think,but it has the biggest time-complexity
The second is better than the first ,but it's still not perfect
The third is the best of three program, it's linear,and we can learn some from it
